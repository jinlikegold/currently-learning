# Notes on what I'm currently learning &amp; working on day by day

### Week of 9/5 & 9/12: 
Working on building a Chrome extension (for capturing sales leads) through Scrimba's "Making Websites Interactive" module. 
Learned about method for writing HTML within JS, template strings, deploying the extension to the Chrome browser, storing in and calling from localStorage, and JSON conversions between strings and objects.

### 9/23: 
Learning truthy & falsy values in JS, to build in conditionals for the extension's localStorage. This enables the extension to store & display data even across browser refreshes.
