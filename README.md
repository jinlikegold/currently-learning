# Notes on what I'm currently learning &amp; working on day by day

### Week of 9/5 & 9/12: 
Working on building a Chrome extension (for capturing sales leads) through Scrimba's "Making Websites Interactive" module. 
Learned about method for writing HTML within JS, template strings, deploying the extension to the Chrome browser, storing in and calling from localStorage, and JSON conversions between strings and objects.

### 9/23: 
Learning truthy & falsy values in JS, to build in conditionals for the extension's localStorage. This enables the extension to store & display data even across browser refreshes.

### 9/27:
Refreshed CSS styling knowledge, creating a delete button that clears out stored data as well as the DOM, learned to refactor code! Using parameters and arguments with functions to make them dynamic & reusable.

### 9/28:
Starting to work with an API! First reviewing calling data points from within object key-value pairs. Then learned how to look up and use a Chrome API to access data from the current tab, so as to pull it into the app. App is now complete, ready to be deployed.
